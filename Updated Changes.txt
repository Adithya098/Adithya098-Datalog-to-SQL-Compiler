Create a database called "datalog_compiler"

Install these first:
pip install psycopg2
pip install watchdog

Run Main.py

This would 
1. Delete all instances of tables,views in the database which was created previosuly, before execution.
2. when we execute the main.py, it the instance of database is fresh. so we should start from the first command," s(x, y). "

Running the Main.py creates "output_queries.sql" everytime it runs.
this sql file  is updated live on the vscode. it is updated and saved with every execution. it is is automatically refreshed.
This file should be loaded into the postgres and relaoded everytime the main.py script is run.

Thus, The datalog queries are being turned into sql queries dynamically.


I have added a new .py file called SQL Handler and these are the functions I added and their one line summary:
1. reload_sql_file   :  Reloads the SQL file into the PostgreSQL instance. 
2. execute_sql_query :  Executes a given SQL query. [cur.execute(sql_query)]
3. drop_all_objects  :  Drops all tables, views, sequences, and functions associated with the current database.

Now I have added 1 fucntions to main.py
append_to_sql_file : Appends a SQL query to a specified output file, followed by two newline characters.
