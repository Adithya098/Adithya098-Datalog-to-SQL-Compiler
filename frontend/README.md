Check if npm is intalled. I just download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download

```npm -v```

To install all react dependencies, cd to directory containing package.json. 

``` npm install react-scripts --save-dev```

To start the backend, open a terminal.
```python3 app.py```

To start the frontend, open another terminal.
```npm start```
